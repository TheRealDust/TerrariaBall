# TerrariaBall
This mod is a "fan rewrite" of the original Dragon Ball Terraria Mod. 
Much of that mod's code is poorly optimized due to its age, and until the 1.1 version is released the mod causes severe performance issues, especially on multiplayer/servers. The changes made in this "rewrite" are generally focused around optimizing it's performance, with a few minor changes in drop rates or drop locations of "power-up" items to balance the mod, primarily in the early game. This is by no means a replacement for the upcoming 1.1 release.

All credit for the assets used in this mod, the mechanics and of course the original idea goes to the developers of the original mod, who you can find over at:
