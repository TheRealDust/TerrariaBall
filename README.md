# TerrariaBall
This mod is a "fan rewrite" of the original Dragon Ball Terraria Mod. 
Much of that mod's code is poorly optimized, typically due to its age. As a result, it can cause severe performance issues, especially on multiplayer/server environments (this effect is most noticeable during boss fights). While it is expected that the 1.1 version will solve a lot of the performance problems, at this time it is unknown how long it will be until said version's public release. The changes made in this "rewrite" are generally focused around optimizing it's performance, with a few minor changes in drop rates or drop locations of "power-up" items to balance the mod, primarily in the early game. Please keep in mind that while recipe viewing mods will reflect the updated/custom item information, the mod's original wiki may not.

This is by no means a replacement for the upcoming 1.1 release, and we encourage users to play on any updated version of the original mod should it become available.

All credit for the assets used in this mod (including but not limited to sounds and sprites), the mechanics and of course the idea itself goes to the developers of the original mod, who you can find over at:
